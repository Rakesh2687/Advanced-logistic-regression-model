# Advanced Regression - Assignment
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

## Table of Contents
* Introduction 
* [Technologies Used] (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy)
* Conclusions
* The change in alpha value was very minimal, the change in R2 and MSE remained almost the same which did not have much impact. the predictor variables also hardly changed, only a few variables have minimal increase than the other variables.
* The optimum value of lambda for ridge and lasso are as follows:
Ridge - 2,Lasso - 0.0001
Ridge square for Ridge-0.8308526739483172 and Lasso-0.8356403844911493
Mean Square Error 
Ridge - 0.0026219108677012896 and Lasso - 0.00254769775067085
The mean square error difference is minimal, it doesnâ€™t have much impact.
since lasso has the top edge in featuring few of the variables near zero it has quite a higher weightage compared to the ridge model
Top five significant variable includes: 1) total square footage area 2) Garage area 3) Total rooms above grade 4) overall condition 5) lot area

## General Information
- The database was in csv file named train.csv
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
## Conclusions
- The model buit is sginificant and tested. The model is not overfitted, not biaed and has least variance. Ridge and Lasso regression were performed over the model. Further detailed conclusion is seen in part 1 file and also in part 2 (pdf)
